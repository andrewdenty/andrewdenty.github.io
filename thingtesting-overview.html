            <p>Thingtesting is a review and product testing platform designed to help consumers discover and buy better
                products.</p>
            <p>As the Head of Design at Thingtesting, I oversee the entire design function and collaborate closely on
                product strategy to maintain a user-centric focus. My responsibilities include defining design
                processes, leading product design initiatives, and hiring for the design team. I manage the full design
                lifecycle, from user research and ideation to high-fidelity mock-ups and implementation.</p>
            <p>This page showcases selected projects from my time at Thingtesting.</p>

        <h3>Thingtesting reviews</h3>
        <p>Reviews are at the heart of Thingtesting. The review page serves as a central hub where consumers read
            reviews, ask questions, try products, discover alternative brands, and eventually make the leap to purchase
            if and when they’re ready.</p>
        <p>Over time, this page had gradually evolved to include far more content than it was originally designed for.
            After collecting end-user feedback and analysing usage data, I redesigned this page in early 2024 in order
            to simplify the reading experience and better meet the needs of review readers. </p>
        <p>Since then, I’ve continuously iterated and refined the review reading experience based on user feedback,
            experiments, and SEO best practices. Notable improvements include AI-generated summaries, the ability to
            sort and filter reviews, browse reviews through a photo gallery, and the ability to read reviews of specific
            products.

        <h3>Discussions and replies</h3>
        <p>In 2024, we enhanced Thingtesting to be more conversational. </p>
        <p>We had noticed in-depth conversations about brands on platforms such as Reddit and realised that once a
            reviewer had written a review on Thingtesting, we didn’t provide many avenues to continue the discussion. To
            address this, we introduced the ability to reply to other people’s reviews, ask questions, and engage in
            deeper discussions about brands and products.</p>
        <p>Our objective with this feature was to test whether introducing more meaningful conversations and posts that
            could be questions or general discussions could enhance contributor engagement, create a valuable community
            resource, and ultimately boost organic traffic.</p>

        <h3>Best of Thingtesting and Thingtesting Gift Guides</h3>
        <p>Consumers often told us that they looked to Thingtesting for recommendations within product categories. To
            address this need, we created the Best of Thingtesting, designed as an always-up-to-date best-of category
            view to help consumers discover the best-rated brands on Thingtesting. We integrated Best of Thingtesting
            tightly throughout the platform so that readers always have helpful recommendations for brands to consider
            within a product category.</p>
        <p>We later followed this up with curated gift guides where we partnered with influencers and trendsetters to
            give consumers the option of both data-driven and opinion-driven recommendations.</p>
