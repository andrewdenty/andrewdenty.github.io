        <h3>Identifying the problem</h3>
        <p>On initially starting the project I ran a heuristic analysis session to identify the most obvious problems with the usability of ReadyRollâ€™s set-up process. I ran the session with an extended group of Redgate employees (many of whom were not familiar with ReadyRoll). The session identified a large number of issues, which I mapped and grouped to help highlight the areas that most would benefit from redesign.

            <h3>Creating a library of components for designers</h3>
            <p>My main focus has been on developing a library of easily sharable components for designers. </p>
            <p>Although we had made significant progress in developing a design system, designers were still finding it time consuming to create high fidelity mock-ups. There was no easy way of sharing components and specifications, or updating designs after changes were made to Honeycomb. This also meant there was duplication of work, with designers individually mocking up existing components, and subsequently inconsistencies arose. For example, when auditing how Honeycomb had been implemented in the wild, I discovered over 6 interpretations of what a primary Honeycomb button looks like.</p>

            <p class="small">Spot the Honeycomb button.</p>
            <p>After evaluating numerous approaches, and gathering requirements from colleagues around Redgate I developed a shared library of components using Sketch and Brand AI. I created over a hundred reusable components and developed a process for contributing to the component library, and have kept it up to date.</p>

            <p>Subsequently I have run training sessions and produced documentation to get other designers up to speed with the library and provide ongoing support.</p>
            <p>I am giving a talk on the topic this September at <a href="http://uxcambridge.net/2017/sessions/index.php?session=54 ">UX Cambridge</a></p>

        <h3>Outcome </h3>
        <p>The resulting design simplified the set-up process into three simple steps which guide users through creating a new project, connecting to a source database and then running an initial import.</p>
        <p>We started to see a significant improvement in the number of users who successfully set up ReadyRoll after the redesigned set-up process was shipped (insert figures).</p>
