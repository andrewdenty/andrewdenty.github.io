        <p>I have played a central role in the development of Redgate’s design system, Honeycomb. I work with a Web Developer and a Graphic Designer in order to design, document and share components.</p>
        
        <p>My main contributions have been to build a flexible library of components for designers and to design more complex patterns (such as an in-product notifications) to ensure Redgate's customers have a coherent experience.

            <h3>Building a library of components for designers</h3>
            <p>My main focus has been on developing a library of easily sharable components for designers. </p>
            <p>Although we had made significant progress in developing a design system, designers were still finding it time consuming to create high fidelity mock-ups. There was no easy way of sharing components and specifications, or updating designs after changes were made to Honeycomb. This also meant there was duplication of work, with designers individually mocking up existing components, and subsequently inconsistencies arose. For example, when auditing how Honeycomb had been implemented in the wild, I discovered over 6 interpretations of what a primary Honeycomb button looks like.</p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p class="small"></p>
            <p>After evaluating numerous approaches, and gathering requirements from colleagues around Redgate I developed a shared library of components using Sketch and Brand AI. I created over a hundred reusable components and developed a process for contributing to the component library, and have kept it up to date.</p>

            <p>Subsequently I have run training sessions and produced documentation to get other designers up to speed with the library and provide ongoing support.</p>
            <p>I am giving a talk on the topic this September at <a href="http://uxcambridge.net/2017/sessions/index.php?session=54 ">UX Cambridge</a></p>
