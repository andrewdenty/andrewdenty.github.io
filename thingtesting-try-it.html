            <p class="caption tight"> 2023 - 2025 &nbsp; • &nbsp; <a href="https://thingtesting.com"

            <p>As the Lead Designer for Thingtesting’s “Try It” product, I tackled the challenge of turning organic
                growth into revenue by addressing brands’ most pressing pain points. By combining research, design, and
                iteration, we built a product that helped brands drive in-store sales, gain insights, and expand their
                retail presence—all while learning valuable lessons along the way.</p>

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>Previous monetisation attempts had fallen short—primarily because Thingtesting hadn’t yet reached a
            scale where brands saw it as an essential platform. However, with strong organic growth among end
            users, the timing was right to explore a sustainable monetisation model that aligned with both brand
            and user needs.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>We had a working assumption that Thingtesting’s most valuable proposition for brands would be data
            insights. To test this assumption, I conducted a series of open-ended interviews with brands,
            ensuring we avoided bias and uncovered genuine needs.</p>
        <p>We identified a set of <a href="https://www.learnmorefaster.com/" target="_blank"> bullseye customers
            </a> — emerging brands experiencing strong growth but not yet reaching a mainstream audience. To
            accelerate learning, I developed a research plan and coached the team to conduct paired interviews,
            allowing us to gather insights more efficiently.</p>
        <h4>Key findings</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Brands weren’t willing to pay for data. </strong> While insights were useful, they were
                seen as a “nice-to-have” rather than a critical investment.</li>
            <li><strong>Driving sales volume was the top priority. </strong> Every brand we spoke to was
                actively spending to increase sales.</li>
            <li><strong>Retail expansion was a challenge. </strong>Many brands were shifting from
                direct-to-consumer (DTC) to in-store retail due to rising online acquisition costs. However,
                success depended on driving sales velocity.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of transparency in retail. </strong>Brands struggled to track where and why
                customers were buying their products, leaving them with little visibility into the in-store
                experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These findings made it clear that a data-driven monetisation strategy wouldn’t work. Instead, we
            needed to explore a model that directly supported brands’ sales and retail expansion efforts.

        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p>Based on our research, we concluded that our monetisation strategy needed to directly support brands
            in driving sales, as this was their most pressing challenge. Rather than building a
            one-size-fits-all solution, we decided to focus on a specific segment: brands expanding into retail.
            This group faced a well-defined problem that we were uniquely positioned to solve—helping them drive
            in-store sales and measure their retail performance.</p>

        <p class="caption">We tested simple landing pages with a sign up form that allowed consumers to register and
            participate in offers </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <h3>Launch and Iteration</h3>
        <p>I iterated from early prototypes to build the simplest possible version of the product, prioritizing the
            end-user experience over brand-facing features. This initial version allowed users to discover offers on
            Thingtesting, sign up, receive participation instructions, and upload a receipt as proof of
            purchase—creating a seamless, low-friction way to validate purchases.
        </p>
        <p>To maximize learning and agility, I pushed for a concierge approach with brands. This allowed us to focus on
            refining the user experience while working closely with early brand partners, gathering valuable insights to
            inform future iterations.
        </p>
        <h4>Key iterations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Launched with a <strong>single landing page</strong> to validate demand.</li>
            <li>Later integrated offers directly into <strong>Thingtesting’s product and review pages</strong> for a
                more seamless user experience.</li>
            <li>Built <strong>self-service tools for brands</strong>, enabling them to create and manage their own
                campaigns as well as create custom landing pages and surveys.</li>
            <li>Expanded the program to support <strong>direct online sales</strong>, designing and launching a shopping
                cart and checkout flow.</li>
            <li>Developed a <strong>refined brand identity for Try It</strong>, ensuring a consistent message for end
                users. The focus was on positioning Try It as an <strong>exciting way to discover new products</strong>
                rather than a traditional discount program.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Branding</h3>
        <p>We Launched with a simple branding, but later when we had more confidence in the approach spent time
            developing a brand.
            Important to position away from discounts even though that’s what we were essentially offering.
            Thingtesting’s mission is to help people discover and try new exciting products, so a different approach was
            required.
            I landed on a concept of presenting products like they were in an art gallery - inspired by Art gallery
            concepts
            For this project, I thought about how museums and galleries design present their exhibitions in order to
            elevate what we were offering.</p>
