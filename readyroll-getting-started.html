            <h2>Redesigning the ReadyRoll set-up experience</h2>
            <p> ReadyRoll is a powerful, versatile tool for managing database development within Visual Studio. Although it had a loyal following of early adopter users, we were receiving regular feedback that new users were finding ReadyRoll difficult to set up.</p>

        <h3>Identifying the problem</h3>
        <p>Feedback and usability research consistently showed that new users were struggling to set up ReadyRoll.</p>
        <p> In order to quickly identify areas for improvement, I ran a heuristic analysis session to identify the most obvious problems with the usability of ReadyRoll’s set-up process. I conducted the session with wide group of Redgate employees (many of whom were not familiar with ReadyRoll). The session identified a large number of issues, which I mapped and grouped to highlight the areas that most would benefit from redesign.

        <h3>Idea generation and user research </h3>
        <p>A key problem identified in the heuristic analysis was that although it was possible to set up ReadyRoll (after reading the documentation), there was no clear guidance of which tasks a user needs to complete to successfully set up ReadyRoll.</p>
        <p>In order to begin designing an improved experience, I mapped out the tasks which need to be completed in order to set up ReadyRoll, and used this to sketch ideas for how we could improve the set-up process.</p>
        <p>I developed these sketches into low fidelity mock-ups which were shared internally, and refined, before scheduling usability sessions. For the usability sessions I built interactive mock-ups using Sketch and Invision. I tested these on existing users and potential new users. Throughout this process the designs evolved and iterated several times before reaching a point where we were happy to start building them.

            <h3>Outcome </h3>
            <p>The resulting design simplified the set-up process into three simple steps which guide users through creating a new project, connecting to a source database and then running an initial import. This process appeared to increase the speed at which users completed the set up task.</p>
            <p>After we released this feature to users, we saw a significant improvement in the number of users who successfully set up ReadyRoll.</p>
