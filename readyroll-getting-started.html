            <h2>Redesigning the ReadyRoll set-up experience <small>(2016)</small></h2>
            <p class="page-intro">ReadyRoll is a powerful, versatile tool for managing database development within Visual Studio. </br>Although it had a loyal following of early adopter users, we were receiving regular feedback that ReadyRoll was too difficult to set up for new users.</p>

        <h3>Identifying the problem</h3>
        <p>On initially starting the project I ran a heuristic analysis session to identify the most obvious problems with the usability of ReadyRollâ€™s set-up process. I ran the session with an extended group of Redgate employees (many of whom were not familiar with ReadyRoll). The session identified a large number of issues, which I mapped and grouped to help highlight the areas that most would benefit from redesign.

            <h3>Idea generation and user research </h3>

            <p>The key problem identified in the heuristic analysis were that although it was possible to set up ReadyRoll (after reading the documentation), there was no clear guidance of which tasks a user needs to complete to successfully set up ReadyRoll.</p>
            <p>In order to begin designing an improved experience, I mapped out the tasks which need to be completed in order to set up ReadyRoll and used this to start sketching ideas for how we could improve the set-up process.</p>
            <p>I developed these sketches into low fidelity mock-ups which were shared internally, and refined, before scheduling usability sessions. For the usability sessions I built interactive mock-ups using Sketch and Invision. I tested these on existing users, and potential new users. Throughout this process the designs evolved and iterated several times. Before they got to a point where we were happy to start building them.

        <h3>Outcome </h3>
        <p>The resulting design simplified the set-up process into three simple steps which guide users through creating a new project, connecting to a source database and then running an initial import.</p>
        <p>We started to see a significant improvement in the number of users who successfully set up ReadyRoll after the redesigned set-up process was shipped (insert figures).</p>
