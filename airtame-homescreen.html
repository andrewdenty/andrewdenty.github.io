            <h2>Airtame Homescreen</h2>
            <p>Airtame is a device which lets people present wirelessly from any computer or device.
                The Airtame homescreen is the first thing people see when they walk into a room with an Airtame
                connected TV.</p>
                <p>
                I led the redesign of the Airtame Homescreen. I worked on this feature from its conception
                through to helping launch it in mid-2019.

        <h3>Identifying the opportunity</h3>
        <p>The previous Airtame Homescreen was a simple screen which contained instructions about how to connect to the
            screen as well as a background image which can be specified by an IT administrator. It was typically found
            in meeting rooms and classrooms and displaying all day while screens were not in use.</p>
        <p>There was a feeling that this was a wasted opportunity. The current Homescreen did nothing to help the users
            of a room other than provide connection instructions.</p>
        <p>This was backed up by customer feedback asking for increased customisability and elements such as the time. We also learned that the on-screen guidance was innadequate as many customers provided printed guides alongside the tv.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
            <h3>Scoping the project</h3>
            <p>Working closely with a Product Manager, I trawled through customer feedback and past research to map out the various different types of users in numerous situations using Airtame. I used this to identify a number of goals for the new homescreen:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be more aware of its context (for example in a meeting room) and be useful in that context.</li>
                <li>It needs to clearly signpost how to share your screen to the TV</li>
                <li>Be flexible and adapt to our customers’ needs. For example, to support custom imagery and logos </li>
                <li>It’s our end users’ first impression of Airtame and a desire within Airtame to create a design which was more easily recognisable as Airtame without being heavily branded</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Validating the concept</h3>
        <p>Given the vast variety of users that needed to be able to use Airtame, I carried out research whereby I invited the public in to our office directly from the street by offering free drinks and refreshments. (Our office is located centrally in Copenhagen by the harbour, and it was a very hot Summer!)</p>
        <p> While testing usability was important it was also important to ensure the design met the needs of our customer organisations. I validated the designs with the help of our sales team who shared early previews of the design in exchange for feedback.</p>

            <h3>Build, release and validation:</h3>
            <p>I pushed for a gradual rollout of the new homescreen. Many of Airtame's customers work in highly customised, locked-down environments and prefer to adopt features incrementally.</p>
            <p>We initially released to a select group of close customers in exchange for feedback, then released the homescreen as an optional feature, before finally making it the default Airtame experience. This approached allowed us to incorporate feedback on an ongioing basis throughout development.</p>
